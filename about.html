                Simple Map Diagrams is a JavaScript library whose main purpose is to allow developers to 
                create very specific and customizable interactive mini-maps for their web apps. 
                Using this library, you can create maps in which you can add the exact objects 
                you feel are relevant to your webpage, such as roads, buildings, and points of interest. 
                Users will be able to interact with the map by clicking on points of interest 
                to get more information, or by using the side control menu to highlight certain points of 
                interest on the map. This library will save you the time required to add all the DOM 
                elements individually and position them on their page. Instead, you can call on a set of API 
                functions to create the map, add features to it, and customize it as you choose. What differentiates 
                this library from existing alternatives is the freedom to choose exactly what information you want to 
                include, making your maps cleaner, simpler, and more readable for your users.
